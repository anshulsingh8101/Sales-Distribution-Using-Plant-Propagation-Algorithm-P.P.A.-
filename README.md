Sales Distribution Using Plant Propagation Algorithm (P.P.A.) and comparing with 4 different version of particle swarm optimization.

P.P.A. is attractive because, among other things, it is simple to describe and implement. It has been demonstrated to work well on both unconstrained and constrained continuous
optimization problems.

There are four versions of P.S.O. studied by us.
  1. PSO-TS: The PSO based on space transformation
  2. PSO-TS-2opt: PSO-TS combined with 2-opt local search
  3. PSO-TS-CO: PSO-TS with chaotic operations
  4. PSO-TS-CO-2opt: PSO-TS combined with CO and 2-op
  
  The comparision between all of them are below:
